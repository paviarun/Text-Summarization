    "\"Right now, you've got to ensure this is the only person – if they picked up something already – and that the facility is secure,\" he told CNN on Monday as law enforcement are responding to the situation.\n",
    "\"They may give some preliminary information, but it won't be much. It will be pretty sketchy at this point in time. These scenes are very chaotic in the early stages. So it's got to settle down,\" he said.\n",
    "\"They were texting, hiding in the coat closet. Turned their phone off and were going ‘we’re hiding, we’re okay’ you know, ‘don't call’ you know the phone would ring and give away their position,\" he said.\n",
    "\"This feels like the safest spot in America and I just nearly got killed for getting a soda, you know, and a bag of chips. Doesn't feel good,\" he added.\n",
    "\"We told employees what was going on so everybody helped each other and we just ran to safety as quickly as we could,\" Borowski told CNN from behind the store in Boulder, Colorado, about two hours after the shooting.\n",
    "An eyewitness told CNN affiliate KCNC he was inside the King Sooper grocery store at the time of the shooting. \n",
    "Borowski said he was going to get ice cream, but then changed his mind and started walking the other way.\n",

    "Boulder police say the scene is still \"very active,\" but we do not know a lot of information about what happened – including the conditions of people inside the store.\n",
    "Boulder, Colorado, Mayor Sam Weaver thanked police officers and first responders at the scene of an active shooter, saying \"words can do no justice to the tragedy that has unfolded this afternoon.\"\n",
    "By Veronica Rocha, Elise Hammond, Joshua Berlinger and Adam Renton, CNN\n",
    "CNN affiliate KCNC reporter Conor McCue spoke with a man whose family was inside the King Soopers pharmacy to get a Covid-19 vaccine when the shooter arrived. He said they hid in a closet for an hour before being rescued through the roof.\n",
    "CNN affiliate KMGH’s helicopter also filmed several people led away from the King Soopers store by police. SWAT vehicles were also seen moving about, and multiple officers were in tactical positions around the store’s exterior.\n",
    "CNN affiliate KMGH’s helicopter recorded a shirtless man being taken from the supermarket. The man had what appears to be blood on his arm and right leg and his hands appeared to be cuffed behind him as two officers escorted him away. The man was taken away in an ambulance.\n",

    "He said he could have never imagined a situation like this happening in Boulder.\n",
    "He said he heard two loud sounds, and by the third one, he and the people around him realized they were gunshots. He said they started running to the back of the store and employees helped them out the back door.\n",
    "He said his daughter was texting him from the closet, before turning her phone off.\n",
    "He said this is not an easy task, and it will take time to make sure it is safe.\n",
    "He told KCNC: \"We weren't tripping over each other, but we were single file just you know, somebody had their hand on my back, I had my hand on somebody's back, and we were just saying go, go, go, run.\"\n",

    "In the excerpt, Schiller is heard calling out saying that people need to call 9-1-1. \n",
    "Phil Mudd, a former FBI senior intelligence adviser, said at this point in the investigation, police are concerned with two primary things: Making sure the building is secure and finding the shooter, or shooters.\n",
    "Police were also seen moving on the roof of the store, the purposes for the roof movements are unclear.\n",

    "The video, taken by Dean Schiller, is part of a longer live stream that he took as the shooting progressed and police arrived. \n",

    "Watch here:\n",
    "We don't know about the conditions of anyone else in the store at this time.\n",
    "“Please avoid the area of Table Mesa & Broadway! This is still a very active scene,” Boulder police tweeted moments ago. “Do NOT broadcast on social media any tactical information you might see.”\n",
