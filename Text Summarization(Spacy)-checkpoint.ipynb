Schiller is heard on the video asking what appears to be a store employee whether a shooter went into the store.Here's how that conversation played out:\"Yeah, he went in there,\" the man responded.“He went in the store?” Schiller asked.“He went right down there,” the man responds. “Oh my god,” Schiller reacts. “People we got people down inside Kings Soopers.”Schiller then says, “Look there’s-,” but doesn’t finish his sentence as two gunshots stop his speaking.Some background: Boulder Police had tweeted earlier on Monday there was an, “Active Shooter at the King Soopers on Table Mesa.
